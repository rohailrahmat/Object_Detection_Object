GB Roads Object Detection
This project implements an object detection model focused on detecting various objects on roads in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. Using deep learning techniques, the model processes images and identifies specific objects related to road infrastructure, vehicles, and more. This project can be useful for traffic analysis, road safety monitoring, and infrastructure planning.

Project Overview
The GB Roads Object Detection project uses computer vision techniques to detect and classify objects on roads. This model is trained on an annotated dataset from Kaggle, specifically designed for recognizing road infrastructure and traffic objects in diverse conditions.

Features
Image Detection: Detects various objects in road images from Gilgit-Baltistan.
Model Evaluation: Provides accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for performance assessment.
Data Augmentation: Utilizes augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Visualization: Displays annotated images with detected objects.
Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GB_Roads_ObjectDetection.git
cd GB_Roads_ObjectDetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Import the dataset into Google Colab or your local environment.
Training the Model: Run the provided code in the Jupyter Notebook to train the model.
Running Inference: Use the model to make predictions on new road images.
python
Copy code
# Example code for inference
from model import ObjectDetectionModel

model = ObjectDetectionModel()
model.load_weights('path/to/weights')
predictions = model.predict('path/to/image.jpg')
Dataset
The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle and includes labeled images representing various road objects. Ensure you have permission to use the dataset and follow the instructions in the Notebook for importing it into your environment.

Model Training and Evaluation
Training: Follow the instructions in the Notebook to train the object detection model.
Evaluation: The Notebook includes evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Results
After training, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 65% in detecting objects with varied expressions, lighting, and angles. Sample results and visualizations are available in the Notebook.
